# Ashley Smith

Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Ashley, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying Software Development. I currently have my certificates in Web & Computer Programming and Web Development. I am working toward my certificate and bachelors degree in Software Development.

## About Me

- My goal is to finish my degree and help small businesses have resposive, functional websites and apps to help increase their success.
- I love the creativity involved with Frontend Development. Picking colors, fonts and layouts is one of the best parts.
- I enjoy the problem solving of Backend Development. When the button click finally does exactly what I want, it's exciting.
- I have work experience as a Data Specialist and enjoying having a better understanding of how databases work now.
